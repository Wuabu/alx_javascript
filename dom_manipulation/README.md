File Structure
Repository: [alx_javascript](GitHub repository link)
Directory: dom_manipulation
File: 0-select-id.html
Usage
Open the HTML file in a web browser.
The JavaScript code, included within the <script> tag, selects the paragraph element using its id (myParagraph).

File: 1-select-class.html
Usage
Open the HTML file in a web browser.
The JavaScript code, enclosed within the <script> tag, utilizes the DOM API to select all elements with the class highlight.
The content of the selected elements is modified to be boldened, changing their formatting.
Upon opening the HTML file in a browser, you should observe the modified content with boldened text in the highlighted paragraph.
2. Modifying Element Content, Attributes, and Styles
Introduction
This JavaScript program demonstrates the modification of HTML elements, including content, attributes, and styles. The provided HTML code serves as the base for this demonstration.

File Structure
Repository: [alx_javascript](GitHub repository link)
Directory: dom_manipulation
File: 2-select-image.html
Usage
Open the HTML file in a web browser.
The JavaScript code, included within the <script> tag, selects the <img> element using its id (myImage).

3. Creating, Appending, and Removing Elements
Introduction
This JavaScript program demonstrates the creation, appending, and removal of elements within the DOM. The provided HTML code serves as the starting point for the demonstration.

File Structure
Repository: [alx_javascript](GitHub repository link)
Directory: dom_manipulation
File: 3-multiple-actions.html
Usage
Open the HTML file in a web browser.
The JavaScript code, enclosed within the <script> tag, selects the container element using its id (container).
A new <p> element with the content "New paragraph" is created using the DOM API.
The newly created paragraph is appended to the container element.
A button is added to the HTML that, when clicked, toggles the visibility of the newly created paragraph.
Upon opening the HTML file in a browser, you should observe the dynamically created paragraph and the toggle button for hiding/showing the paragraph.
